ozfortress.com's version controlled server configs
last updated: 15th july 2012 by seeker

To use these configurations, clone the repository into orangebox/tf/ and modify rcon_password and hostname within autoexec.cfg to suit your server.

Server logging is disabled in these configs; SourceMod with MatchRecorder is used to produce clean logs which begin and end when the matches do. (https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=92716).
